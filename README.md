This is my symbols collection.
Use it and share it at your leisure.
Although I have done my best in drawing each symbol (I use the same in my schematics) I will not take any responsibility for damages, direct or indirect, caused by the use of this collection. However, you are free to report any errors found in the symbols.

Live long and prosper!

That's all folks.

# kicad-symbols

This is my symbols collection.
Use it and share it at your leisure.
Although I have done my best in drawing each symbol (I use the same in my schematics) I will not take any responsibility for damages, direct or indirect, caused by the use of this collection;
however, you are free to report any issue found in the footprints (use [this](https://github.com/weirdgyn/kicad-footprints/issues) repository section).

Live long and prosper!

That's all folks.
